## Core Philosophy

**Design is not art — it is a story.** The goal is not to impress other designers, but to guide users to action. Start with user intent, not aesthetics. Make things work brilliantly for the user first, then make them beautiful.

**Presentation drives conversion and trust.** AI-generated UIs fail in predictable, fixable ways. This skill provides specific, actionable solutions to transform amateur software into professional products.
